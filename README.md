- A small demo of `LlamaCppChatGenerator` model to generate answers for the questions:
  - `Which year did the Joker movie release?`.
  - `Who is John Edward James?`.

- So I created a small dataset including of 5 records about the product that I am developing at VngCloud. Each records contains **2 fields**:
  - `title`: The title of the documentation.
  - `text`: The content of the documentation.
- Then I asked some simple questions about the VKS products, such as:
  - What is VKS?
  - So could you compare between private and public clusters in VKS?
