"VKS (VNGCloud Kubernetes Service) is a managed service on VNGCloud that simplifies the deployment and management of container-based applications. Kubernetes, an open-source platform developed by Google, is widely used to manage and deploy containerized applications in distributed environments.",What is VKS?
"Fully Managed control plane: VKS will free you from the burden of managing the Kubernetes Control Plane, allowing you to focus on developing applications.

Support for the latest Kubernetes versions: VKS is always updating to the latest Kubernetes versions (minor versions from 1.27, 1.28, 1.29) to ensure you can take advantage of the most advanced features.

Kubernetes Networking: VKS integrates Calico CNI, providing high efficiency and security.

Upgrade seamlessly: VKS supports easy and fast upgrades between Kubernetes versions, helping you stay updated with the latest improvements.

Scaling & Healing Automatically: VKS automatically scales the Node group when needed and repairs issues when nodes encounter problems, saving you time and effort in management.

Reduce costs and enhance reliability: VKS deploys the Kubernetes Control Plane in a highly available mode and completely for free, helping you save costs and improve system reliability.

Integration of Native Blockstore (Container Storage Interface - CSI): VKS allows you to manage Blockstore through Kubernetes YAML, providing persistent storage for containers and supporting important features such as resizing, changing IOPS, and snapshotting volumes.

Integration of Load Balancer (Network Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer) through built-in drivers such as VNGCloud Controller Manager, VNGCloud Ingress Controller: VKS provides the capability to manage NLB/ALB through Kubernetes YAML, making it easy to expose Services in Kubernetes to the outside.

Enhanced security: VKS allows you to create Private Node Groups with only Private IPs and control access to the cluster via the IP Whitelist feature, ensuring the safety of your system.

In addition, VKS has the following advantages:

Easy to use: VKS provides a simple and user-friendly interface.

Affordable pricing: VKS offers competitive pricing for its services.",Highlights of VKS
"When you create a Public Cluster with Public Node Group , the VKS system will:

Create a VM with Floating IP (ie Public IP). Now these VMs (Nodes) can directly join the K8S cluster through this Public IP. By using Public Cluster and Public Node Group, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and expose services without using Load Balancer. This will contribute to cost savings for your cluster.

When you create a Public Cluster with a Private Node Group , the VKS system will:

Create VM without Floating IP (ie without Public IP). At this time, these VMs (Nodes) cannot join the K8S cluster directly. In order for these VMs to join the K8S cluster, you need to use a NAT Gateway ( NATGW ). NATGW acts as a relay station, allowing VMs to connect to the K8S cluster without needing a Public IP. With VNG Cloud, we recommend you use Pfsense or Palo Alto as a NATGW for your Cluster. Pfsense will help you manage incoming and outgoing network traffic (inbound and outbound traffic) effectively, ensuring network security and access management. Besides, using Private Node Group will help you control applications in the cluster more securely, specifically you can limit control plane access rights through the Whitelist IP feature.

"When you create a Public Cluster with Public/Private Node Group , the VKS system will:

To enhance the security of your cluster, we have introduced the private cluster model. The Private Cluster feature helps make your K8S cluster as secure as possible, all connections are completely private from the connection between nodes to the control plane, the connection from the client to the control plane, or the connection from nodes to products. Other services in VNG Cloud such as: vStorage, vCR, vMonitor, VNGCloud APIs,...Private Cluster is the ideal choice for services that require strict access control, ensuring compliance with security regulations and data privacy.",VKS private clusters
"Below is a comparison table between creating and using Public Cluster and Private Cluster on the VKS system:

Criteria

Public Cluster

Private Cluster

Connect

Use Public IP addresses to communicate between nodes and control plane, between clients and control plane, between nodes and other services in VNG Cloud.

Use Private IP addresses to communicate between nodes and control plane, between clients and control plane, between nodes and other services in VNG Cloud.

Security

Medium security since connections use Public IP.

Higher security with all connections private and limited access.

Access management

More difficult to control, access can be managed through the Whitelist feature

Strict access control, all connections are within VNG Cloud's private network, thereby minimizing the risk of external network attacks.

Scalability (AutoScaling)

Easily scalable through Auto Scaling feature .

Easily scalable through Auto Scaling feature .

AutoHealing 

Automatically detect errors and restart the node ( Auto Healing )

Automatically detect errors and restart the node ( Auto Healing )

Accessibility from outside

Easy access from anywhere with internet.

Access from outside must be through other security solutions.

Configuration and deployment

Simpler because it does not require setting up an internal network.

More complex, requires private and secure network configuration.

Cost

Usually lower because there is no need to set up a complex security infrastructure.

Higher cost due to additional security and management components required. Specifically, when using a private cluster, you need to pay for 4 automatically created private service endpoints to connect to services on VNG Cloud.

Flexibility

High, easy to change and access services.

More flexible in applications that require security, but less flexible for applications that require external access.

Therefore:

Public Cluster : Suitable for applications that do not require high security and need flexibility and access from multiple locations. Easy to deploy and manage but has higher security risks.

Private Cluster : Suitable for applications that require high security, strictly complying with security and privacy regulations. Provides stable and secure connectivity, but requires more complex configuration and management, as well as higher costs.",Comparison between using Public Cluster and Private Cluster
